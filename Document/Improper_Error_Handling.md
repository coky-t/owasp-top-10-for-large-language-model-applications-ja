### LLM09:2023 - 不適切なエラー処理 (Improper Error Handling)

**説明:**  
Improper error handling occurs when error messages or debugging information are exposed in a way that could reveal sensitive information, system details, or potential attack vectors to an attacker.

**一般的な不適切なエラー処理の問題:**
- Exposing sensitive information or system details through error messages.
- Leaking debugging information that could help an attacker identify potential vulnerabilities or attack vectors.
- Failing to handle errors gracefully, potentially causing unexpected behavior or system crashes.

**防止方法:**
- Implement proper error handling mechanisms to ensure that errors are caught, logged, and handled gracefully.
- Ensure that error messages and debugging information do not reveal sensitive information or system details. Consider using generic error messages for users, while logging detailed error information for developers and administrators.
- Regularly review error logs and take necessary actions to fix identified issues and improve system stability.

**攻撃シナリオの例:**
_シナリオ #1:_ An attacker exploits an LLM's error messages to gather sensitive information or system details, enabling them to launch a targeted attack or exploit known vulnerabilities.

_シナリオ #2:_ A developer accidentally leaves debugging information exposed in production, allowing an attacker to identify potential attack vectors or vulnerabilities in the system.

By implementing proper error handling mechanisms and ensuring that error messages do not reveal sensitive information, developers can reduce the risk of attackers exploiting LLM vulnerabilities and improve system stability.
